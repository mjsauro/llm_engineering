    "## Interactive AI Model Competition\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an interactive trivia contest where 4 AI models compete: 1 judge model selects words from various domains and provides hints, while 3 player models compete to guess the words. Players earn points for correct guesses, and the first to reach the target score wins!\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Play:\n",
    "1. Configure the game settings (models, target score, points per answer)\n",
    "2. Initialize the game\n",
    "3. Execute turns one by one - each turn:\n",
    "   - Judge selects a word from a domain\n",
    "   - Judge provides a hint\n",
    "   - All 3 players make guesses\n",
    "   - Judge evaluates and awards points\n",
    "   - Judge provides funny commentary\n",
    "   - Scores are displayed\n",
    "4. Game continues until one or more players reach the target score\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "- Understand how multiple AI models can interact\n",
    "- See how AI models can act as judges and players\n",
    "- Learn about game state management\n",
    "- Practice with Ollama API for multiple models\n",
    "- Experience AI-generated commentary and hints\n"

    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game Mechanics\n",
    "- **Judge Model**: Selects words from various domains (geography, animals, food, etc.), generates hints, evaluates guesses, and provides commentary\n",
    "- **Player Models**: Receive domain and hint, generate guesses using their AI reasoning\n",
    "- **Scoring**: Players earn points for correct guesses (default: 10 points)\n",
    "- **Winning**: Game ends when:\n",
    "  - First player(s) to reach target score (default: 100) wins, OR\n",
    "  - Maximum turns reached (if set) - winner is player(s) with highest score\n",
    "- **Multiple Winners**: If multiple players reach target score in the same turn, all win. If max turns reached, all players with highest score win\n",
    "\n",
    "### Domain Management\n",
    "- Judge can select from 8 different domains\n",
    "- Domains can change or repeat between turns\n",
    "- If a domain repeats, the judge ensures a different word is selected\n",
    "\n",
    "### Commentary\n",
    "- Judge generates funny, engaging commentary based on all previous guesses in the game\n",
    "- Commentary is contextual and entertaining\n",
    "- Judge has access to the full game history for context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Turn Structure\n",
    "1. Judge selects domain and word\n",
    "2. Judge generates hint\n",
    "3. All players simultaneously generate guesses\n",
    "4. Judge evaluates all guesses\n",
    "5. Points awarded to correct players\n",
    "6. Judge provides commentary\n",
    "7. Scores displayed\n",
    "8. Check for winners\n"
